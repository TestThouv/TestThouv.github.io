						<p class="mont center" id="intro_p">The rules below are called our SoR (Set of Rules). We take them seriously, and you should too! If you do not follow any of these rules, a member of our Moderation Team will enforce the appropriate sanction for your action. Punishments for non-compliance to the rules can go from a simple warning to being CID-Banned from PigPixel Prison.</p>

						<div class="r_div" id="r1_div">
							<h4 class="r_h4" id="r1_h4">1. Do not <span class="w700">Hack or Mod</span>. If you're using programs and/or applications to get unfair advantages not implemented into Minecraft and/or PigPixel Prison, you know you're hacking and/or modding. Doing either or both of those will result in a severe punishment, decided by the Moderator administrating the sanction.</h4>
						</div>
					
						<div class="r_div" id="r2_div">
							<h4 class="r_h4" id="r2_h4">2. Do not <span class="w700">Advertise</span>. If you advertise your or anyone else's server, it will steal players from us and ultimately result in a degradation of everyone's gaming experience on PigPixel.</h4>
						</div>
					
						<div class="r_div" id="r3_div">
							<h4 class="r_h4" id="r3_h4">3. Do not <span class="w700">Grief</span>. Griefing is the act of irritating and angering people in video games through the use of destruction, construction, or social engineering. That means that pushing people to getting on their nerves is considered as griefing and will have consequences.</h4>
						</div>
					
						<div class="r_div" id="r4_div">
							<h4 class="r_h4" id="r4_h4">4. Do not <span class="w700">PvP</span> in unauthorized areas. Normally, all our mines, minigames, parkours, and all other areas that are not designated for Player v. Player gameplay should be area protected so that PvP is disabled. But, we're all humans and none of us are perfect, so if you find an area in a mine, or anywhere else where you know you shouldn't be able to PvP in, but where you can actually PvP in, then please, don't PvP there, as it might ruin the victims' gaming experience on PigPixel.</h4>
						</div>
					
						<div class="r_div" id="r5_div">
							<h4 class="r_h4" id="r5_h4">5. Do not <span class="w700">Scam or Lie</span>. This is a general rule that applies to many different situations, from not scamming players to not lying to staff when being asked a question.</h4>
						</div>
					
						<div class="r_div" id="r6_div">
							<h4 class="r_h4" id="r6_h4">6. Report any <span class="w700">Exploits</span> to a staff member. Once again, we're all humans and it often happens that we either leave something out or don't think of something, so if you notice an exploit on PigPixel (something that you're able to do but you don't think you should be), please report it to any staff member so we can fix it. Yes, you are allowed to exploit the situation, because it's our error that we didn't think of patching it since the beginning, but at least report it to a staff.</h4>
